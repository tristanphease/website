A simple game made for a game jam. Pretty rough but here it is anyway. The rules for the game jam was that the game had to be [under 13 kb](https://js13kgames.com/). Don't really like how this game turned out but the concept is at least interesting.

Controls:\
Click around, drag the circle around to the doors...
Click the 'spells' on the left to add an outline and try to trace them to cast a spell and hurt the enemies.
