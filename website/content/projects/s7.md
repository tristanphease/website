A project I made back in high school that was intended to allow people to create their own simple programs. Probably too ambitious for its own good but still fun to create and I learned a lot from it.
Quick list of some features:
- Saves projects in browser using [indexeddb](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
- Can write custom javascript to make the objects move around or other things
- Can create objects of different shapes and fill / stroke / rotate using UI
- Organise using multiple scenes
- Can export to a new html file using the custom library to run
