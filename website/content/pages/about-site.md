title = "About Site"
+++
This site is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a neato static site generator, although it seems primarily geared towards building blogs which isn't really what I want this site to be.\
The images are rendered using [blender](https://www.blender.org/).\
You can find the source code for this site on my github [here](Link).

As for why it's designed like this?  
I don't really know, just decided on this, and it seemed like an interesting thing to try. I just want this site to function as a loose collection of things I find interesting / cool / fun / wacky. There are enough sites that are just minimalist blogs with a standard layout and theme so I wanted something more engaging to both view and create.
