This site is built using [zola](https://getzola.org), a nifty static site generator.  
The rest is just simple html + css with a minimal amount of javascript.
You can find the source code for this site on my github [here](https://github.com/tristanphease/website).  
Mainly created it for experimenting with css stuff.
